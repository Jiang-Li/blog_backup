title: Commenly-used Script

```{r setup, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
library(feather)
#opts_chunk$set(engine.path = '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/python3')
```

I often use R, Python, SAS, SQL, and Bash in different
tasks. To make the transfer easier, a list of the commonly-used
script was built for a quick reference.

At the beginning, a data set with missing and duplicated values were simulated. 
This data set was also saved to the feather format, which can be consumed by
Python, too.
```{r}
set.seed(1)
N <- 1000
x1 <- sample(c("A", "B", "C", "D"), N, replace = TRUE)
x2 <- sample(c("A", "B", "C", "D"), N, replace = TRUE)
x3 <- sample(c("A", "B", "C", "D"), N, replace = TRUE)
x4 <- sample(1:10)
x5 <- sample(1:10)
df <- data.frame(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)

for(i in 1:ncol(df)) { # Some missings
  df[ , i][sample(1:nrow(df), sample(10:50))] <- NA
}

library(feather)
path <- "my_data.feather"
write_feather(df, path)
```


## Missing Value

### R

```{r}
colSums(is.na(df))

```

### Python


```{python}
import feather
import pandas as pd
path = 'my_data.feather'
DF = feather.read_dataframe(path)

print(DF.isnull().sum())

```

## Unique

### R

```{r}
df <- iris

colnames(df)

unique(df$Species)
df %>% distinct(Species)

df %>% distinct() %>% count()

dup <- df[duplicated(df),]
df <- df %>% distinct()

```
