<p>There is a moe column in the census data pulled using the <a href="https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/">tidycensus</a>. After doing a mini research on it, I learned that actually this variable is the 90% confidence interval for the population mean. Yihui said “Listen / read / talk and forget; write and remember!”, so I guess it it better to write down something quickly before I forgot it.</p>
<p>When the population mean, <code>$\mu$</code>, is estimated, it is more meaningful to use an interval that represents the probable range. Based on the central limit theorem, the sample mean follows the normal distribution with mean <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> and standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\frac {\sigma}{\sqrt N}\)</span>. Thus, given confidence level, the interval can be estimated by using the sample mean times the SD and quantile.</p>
<p>For example, when the confidence levels are 80%, 85%, 90%, and 95%, the corresponding quantiles are:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>c &lt;- seq(0.8, 0.99, 0.05)
round(qnorm(1-(1-c)/2), 3)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1.282 1.440 1.645 1.960</code></pre>
<p>The moe column in the census data is the Margins of Error (MOE), which is provided for every American Community Survey (ACS) estimate, and is calculated by:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Get the sample standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(s={\sqrt {\frac {\sum _{i=1}^{N}(x_{i}-{\bar {x}})^{2}}{N-1}}}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Get the standard error SE = <span class="math inline">\(SE = \frac {S}{\sqrt N}\)</span>.</li>
<li>$ MOE = 1.645 SE$</li>
</ol>
<p>Because the quantile is 1.645, so the US Census uses 90% confidence interval.</p>
<p>The MOE is easily to be converted to other confidence level. For example, the 95% MOE can be derived using 90% MOE times 1.96/1.645.</p>
