The [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/) is a handy tool to publish a report online and share with the team. Usually, the Markdown, R Makedowan, or R Notebook docuemnts can be easily previewed and published in RStudio. However, what if I want to publish a report composed by Jupyter Notebook?

The idea is to convert the Jupyter Notebook to Markdown. Here is how:

1. Given a sample.ipynb, convert it to markdown file by:
```jupyter nbconvert --to markdown sample.ipynb```
2. Remove the leading spaces by
```sed "s/^[ \t]*//" -i sample.md```
3. Load the markdown fine in RStudio, Preview, and publish it.

That's it!
