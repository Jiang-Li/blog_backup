<p>The <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/">RStudio Connect</a> is a handy tool to publish a report online and share with the team. Usually, the Markdown, R Makedowan, or R Notebook docuemnts can be easily previewed and published in RStudio. However, what if I want to publish a report composed by Jupyter Notebook?</p>
<p>The idea is to convert the Jupyter Notebook to Markdown. Here is how:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Given a sample.ipynb, convert it to markdown file by: <code>jupyter nbconvert --to markdown sample.ipynb</code></li>
<li>Remove the leading spaces by <code>sed &quot;s/^[ \t]*//&quot; -i sample.md</code></li>
<li>Load the markdown fine in RStudio, Preview, and publish it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thatâ€™s it!</p>
