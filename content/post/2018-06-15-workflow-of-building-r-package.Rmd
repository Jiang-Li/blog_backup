Thanks to RStudio and the *usethis* and *ROxygen* packages, the building of a R
package is much convenient. Here is a typical workflow:

1. Initialize the project of package
```
usethis::create_package("...")
```
2. Modify the description
3. Copy and save R code in the /R folder
4. Build -> Load All
5. Remove the library(...) in the code, and add the packages by
```
usethis::use_package("...")
```
6. Build -> Check
7. Write help for each function: Code -> Insert ROxygen Skeleton
8. Assign the other packages' functions using in the code
```
  @importFrom package function1, function2...
```  
9. Build -> Documents
10. usethis::use_readme_md()
11. Build -> build binary

Done!
